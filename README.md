# Traffic Light Prototype Based on PLC Omron CP1H

- PLC Omron CP1H R&D as the control center and schematic design of the traffic light system wiring
- Programmed algorithm for operating a traffic light system with the crossroads concept based on PLC language program (ladder diagrams) in the CX Programmer
- Develop and Design HMI (Human Machine Interface) and RTC (Real-Time Clock) as a simulation dashboard and debugging program in the CX Designer

# Project Test Documentation

- System Simulation (Ladder Diagram and HMI) Using CX Programmer and CX Designer
